This workshop will be an introduction to understanding how to utilize Jupyter Notebooks to create reproducible computational workflows. Attendees will learn how to build notebooks that contain a combination of explanatory markdown formatted text and python code. Lessons will address how to load data from formats such as .csv or .tsv files, how to clean up data that has been loaded, and how to analyze this data. The workshop will conclude with attendees utilizing the skills they are taught to wrangle a real-life dataset and visualize its contents. Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib will be utilized.
